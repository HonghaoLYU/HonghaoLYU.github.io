### Bio
I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in mechatronic engineering with the School of Mechanical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, 
and also a joint Ph.D. with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, 
under the financial support from China Scholarship Council.
I developed dual-arm robotic teleoperation systems based on the motion capture techniques. And I am also working on mobile robotics, multi-robot coordination, 
and DDS-based functional safety, as an Intern Ph.D. student with the ABB Corporate Research Sweden.
My research interests include dual-arm robotic teleoperation, human–robot intelligent interface, and safe interaction.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/HonghaoLYU/tmp_repo/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/HonghaoLYU/tmp_repo/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
