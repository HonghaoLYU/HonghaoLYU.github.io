### Bio:
I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in mechatronic engineering with the School of Mechanical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, 
and also a joint Ph.D. with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, 
under the financial support from China Scholarship Council.
I developed dual-arm robotic teleoperation systems based on the motion capture techniques. And I am also working on mobile robotics, multi-robot coordination, 
and DDS-based functional safety, as an Intern Ph.D. student with the ABB Corporate Research Center Sweden.
My research interests include dual-arm robotic teleoperation, human–robot intelligent interface, and safe interaction.
