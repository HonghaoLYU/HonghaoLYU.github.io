### Bio
I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in mechatronic engineering with the School of Mechanical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, 
and the joint Ph.D. degree with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, 
under the financial support from China Scholarship Council.
I developed dual-arm robotic teleoperation systems based on the motion capture techniques. And I am also working on mobile robotics, multi-robot coordination, 
and DDS-based functional safety, as an Intern Ph.D. student with the ABB Corporate Research Sweden. I received the B.Eng. degree in mechanical engineering from 
the China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 2018.
My research interests include dual-arm robotic teleoperation, human–robot intelligent interface, and safe interaction.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/HonghaoLYU/tmp_repo/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/HonghaoLYU/tmp_repo/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
